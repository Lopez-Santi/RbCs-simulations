Welcome to RbCs-simulations.

The goal is to have an organized place to store simulations that the various subgroups create for future use.
Many of the simulations that are made can be utilized in the future and built upon, so it will be very useful
to be able to reference these.

General rules / guidelines.
- Add a folder with the code and a short yet descriptive title.
- In the folder have a README.txt with general information about what the code does and any bugs/issues.
- Try to have good comments in the code so future students can understand what is happening.

Might be useful to add folders for the different subgroups in the future.

Add some more guidlines...
